## **🧠 How It Works - The Intelligence Behind LeetPath**

Our recommendation system employs a sophisticated four-layer architecture:

### **1. Content-Based Filtering (TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity) 📝**

The foundation layer that identifies textually similar questions:

- **TF-IDF Analysis**: Converts question text into numerical vectors emphasizing unique, important keywords
  - **Term Frequency (TF)**: Measures keyword prominence within individual questions
  - **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: Identifies rare, specialized terms across the entire dataset
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures angular similarity between question vectors
  - Score near 1 = highly similar questions
  - Score near 0 = unrelated questions

**Result**: Questions sharing important keywords are identified and connected 🎯

### **2. Topic Modeling 📚**

Goes beyond keywords to understand conceptual themes:

- **Latent Topic Discovery**: Automatically identifies subject clusters (e.g., "Dynamic Programming," "Graph Theory")
- **Probabilistic Classification**: Each question gets probability scores across multiple topics
- **Conceptual Grouping**: Links questions that are thematically related even with different vocabulary

**Example**: "Calculate circle area" and "Triangle perimeter formula" both classify under "Basic Geometry"

### **3. Markov Random Field (MRF) 🌐**

Creates an intelligent network mapping all question relationships:

- **Node Structure**: Each question becomes a network node with attributes:
  - Difficulty level
  - User engagement metrics  
  - Topic probability distributions
- **Edge Weights**: Connection strength based on:
  - Content similarity scores
  - Topic overlap percentages
  - User behavioral patterns
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Considers content, context, and user interaction data

**Result**: A comprehensive relationship map between all questions

### **4. Belief Propagation ✨**

Refines the network through iterative message passing:

- **Indirect Influence**: Questions influence each other through network propagation
- **Message Passing**: Nodes exchange "beliefs" about relationships with neighbors
- **Convergence**: System reaches stable state with optimized connection weights
- **Hidden Relationships**: Discovers non-obvious question prerequisites and progressions

**Final Output**: Sophisticated recommendations considering direct similarity, conceptual relationships, and learning pathways

## **🔄 Complete Workflow**

1. **Question Analysis**: Extract TF-IDF vectors and topic distributions
2. **Network Integration**: Place question as MRF node with calculated connections  
3. **Belief Propagation**: Refine relationships through network-wide optimization
4. **Smart Recommendations**: Suggest questions based on strengthened network connections
